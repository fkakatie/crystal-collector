# A Considerable Crystal Caper #

Steal as many crystals as you can without arousing suspicion. Is the pirate's life for you? :gem::skull:

## What this project does ## 

This project is mainly contained in simple `object`, containing all game `variables` and `methods`. Random numbers are generated with `for loops` and `if-else statements` and user input is collected with `on-click functions`.

## How users can get started with this project ## 

### How to Play: ###

1. **[Start the game](https://fkakatie.github.io/crystal-collector/)**.
    - Under the title, piratey game instructions will appear. A piece of parchment below will give some friendly game instructions. The target value, current haul, user scores, and the crystals will display beneath the parchment.

2. **Select crystals to increase your current haul to match the target value**.
    - Each crystal is worth a different value and clicking each crystal will increase your current haul by its value.

3. **Win or lose**.
    - If you successfully increase your current haul exactly to the target value, you'll earn a win! The message on the parchment will congratulate you on your victory.
    - If your current haul exceeds the target value, you'll incur a loss. The message on the parchment will invite you to try again.

4. **Play again**!
    - After either a win or a loss, your current haul will clear and each crystal will be assigned a new value, allowing you to keep playing as long as you'd like.
